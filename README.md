## takeAwayFood

The concept of my project was to develop a demo app through which users can order their food and pick up their food from the restaurant. This app can be used in the office areas where office employees can order their food and at lunchtime they can pick their food. This way they don't have to stand in the long queue for getting their food. It can also be used by the restaurants how just provide take away options and don't deliver the food.

The app consists of two different areas:-
### 1. Merchant 2. User

## Merchant

This area is used by merchants who want to get connected with the app to expand their business. Merchant can see all the current orders and can decide whether to accept the order or reject the order. 
All the accepted orders are displayed in the Accepted order area. 
Merchant can update the user about their order through the two options provided to them. 
Once the cooking button is clicked user gets notified that their order has begun to cook and they can pick their order within 20 mins from the restaurant.

## User

This area is used by the users to get connected with the app. Users can view all the nearby restaurants and can order their food from their favorite restaurants.
Users can even track their order status through the app. They can also view their previous orders in the app.
